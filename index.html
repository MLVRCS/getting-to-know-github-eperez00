<h1>Pillars of Creation, first captured in 1995
</h1>
<p>The iconic, candy-colored images of the pillars in visible light are not the only versions that Hubble has captured. In 2014, the space telescope also took a ghostly picture of the scene in infrared light (above). Light at infrared wavelengths shines through the pillarsâ€™ gas and dust, revealing the baby stars swaddled inside these clouds...
 They could reveal the greatest mysteries about star formation.</p>
